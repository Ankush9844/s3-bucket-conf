If we need public access on objects like png, jpeg, etc.
We need to add Content-Type in Metadata.
Example: - 
Common MIME Types for Images:

    PNG : image/png
    JPEG: image/jpeg
    GIF : image/gif
    BMP : image/bmp
    WebP: image/webp
    PDF : application/pdf

Note: Supposed, bucket is publicaly accessible and have necessary policies for that.
